## Overview

This is my personal notes and modified codes accompanying the book "Neural Networks and Deep Learning"

The original code repo for the book and written by the author is [here](https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning).

And [here](https://github.com/MichalDanielDobrzanski/DeepLearningPython35) is the python 3.5 version contributed by others.


## Description
This repo is for Python 3.5.2 and Theano with CUDA support

The testing file (`test.py`) contains all three networks (`network.py`, `network2.py`, `network3.py`) from the book and it is the starting point to run (i.e. *train and evaluate*) them.

Just type at shell: 

```bash
python3.5 test.p
```

In `test.py` there are examples of networks configurations with proper comments.
